[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| **MODE** | Easy
| **Components** | Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) Gateway UI
| **Namespace** | `aap-rh1`

### 🎯 Objectives

* Find out why the AAP Gateway API pods are failing to start or operate.
* Log in to the AAP UI to verify that the fix was successful and the system is working again.

### 🚀 Initial Setup and Failure Injection

Perform the following steps to deploy the environment and inject the deliberate break.

.   **Deploy the Scenario**
    Run the following command in your lab environment and select **Scenario 3** when prompted to set up the lab components.
    [source,bash]
    ----
    ansible-playbook site.yml -t deploy
    ----

.   **Inject the Failure**
    Run the following command to introduce the issue that prevents the Gateway UI from working correctly. Again, select **Scenario 3**.
    [source,bash]
    ----
    ansible-playbook site.yml -t break
    ----

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Steps

Follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the two issues in the scenario.

#### **Issue 1: Pod Failure**

.   **Diagnose the First Issue**
    Examine the logs and status of the pods within the `aap-rh1` namespace to determine why the Gateway component is failing.

TIP: **Hint 1: Database Connectivity**::
Does the database have connection to the Gateway API pod? What OpenShift resource is needed for one pod to talk to another (e.g., NetworkPolicy or Service)?

.   **Apply the First Fix**
    Once you have identified the underlying cause of the first issue, run the fix playbook. Select **Scenario 3** when prompted.
    [source,bash]
    ----
    ansible-playbook site.yml -t fix
    ----

#### **Issue 2: Login Failure**

.   **Diagnose the Second Issue**
    The pods should now be running, but you may encounter an issue when attempting to log in to the AAP UI. Check the logs of the **Gateway API pod** for clues related to authentication or access.

TIP: **Hint 2: Networking and Authentication**::
If you are having issues logging in, take a look at the Gateway API pod logs for clues about connectivity to the authentication service. It often relates to a missing or improperly configured networking resource.

.   **Apply the Second Fix and Verify**
    Once you have identified the second issue, run the fix playbook again. Select **Scenario 3** when prompted, and then **verify that you can successfully log in** to the AAP Gateway UI.
    [source,bash]
    ----
    ansible-playbook site.yml -t fix
