= 💡 Scenario #6: Solutions and Resolution

This page provides the detailed solution for the issue presented in Scenario #6, which involves an Execution Environment image pull failure due to authentication issues.

---

## 🛑 Problem: Missing Execution Environment Credential

### Diagnosis

One of the job templates was configured to use an **Execution Environment (EE)** image hosted in a private container registry (e.g., a Quay repository). The job failed because the necessary **Container Registry Credential** was not linked to the job template, resulting in an image pull failure.

The error message in the `automation-job` pod logs confirms the authentication failure.

### 🛠️ Resolution: Switching the Execution Environment

The solution is to modify the failing job template to reference an Execution Environment that is properly authenticated or publicly accessible.

#### 1. Identify and Edit the Failing Job Template

[.instruction]
====
Log in to the **Automation Controller UI** and navigate to the **Job Templates**. Select the template that failed execution.
====

#### 2. Change the Execution Environment

[.instruction]
====
Edit the job template configuration and switch the **Execution Environment** field.

----
# The Fix:
Switch the assigned Execution Environment to match the image being successfully used by the other job templates.
----

[NOTE]
====
The failing template was likely using an EE from a private Quay repo without a matching credential. Switching it to a known good EE resolves the authentication gap.
====

#### 3. Verification

[.instruction]
====
Save the configuration and launch the job template again.

# Expected Result
The job will successfully start, confirming the EE is now pulled correctly.
